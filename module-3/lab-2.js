let three = "3"
let four = "4"
let thirty = "30"
//what is the value of the following expressions?
let addition = three + four // = 34 because the first value is a string and when adding a number to a string js concatinates it to the string instead of adding
let multiplication = three * four // = 12 because js converts both stings to numbers
let division = three / four // = .75 because js converts both stings to numbers
let subtraction = three - four // = -1 because js converts both stings to numbers
let lessThan1 = three < four // = true, the string value of 3 is less than the string value of 4
let lessThan2 = thirty < four // = true, because js only looks at the first "didget" the value of 3 is used in the equation instead of 30
